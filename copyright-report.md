#### 1. Platform Copyright Policy Analysis

I chose to work with Vimeo

Research and document the platform's copyright policy:

- How does the platform detect copyrighted content? (automated systems like Content ID, manual reporting, etc.)  
  There is an automated copy right detection and there is also manual DMCA takedowns that you can submit to Vimeo.
- What happens when content is flagged as potentially infringing?  
  The video is set to private and Vimeo sends you an email prompting you to take action within 48 hours to resolve the copyright
  issue.
- What is the appeals or counter-notification process?  
  There is an appeal link that you can click where you can submit a challenge to the copy right claim but you must submit proof supporting the challenge that you submit.
- How does the platform handle monetization of content containing copyrighted material?  
  Vimeo's business model seems to be more of a tool for businesses to host videos through them. For example, you can create
  a show or something and put it on your platform via Vimeo OTT (over the top) as the host of the content. For this reason,
  Vimeo doesn't monetize based on ads so if you upload copyrighted content that is monetized, the video gets privated so
  you would lose your sales or your customers would complain or the video gets a manual DMCA takedown, which would result in the same thing, no more customers would buy the show from your platform so it's in your incentive to make sure the videos stay up.
- Are there any special programs (e.g., YouTube's Content ID licensing agreements)?  
  The special program is Vimeo OTT, which is basically vimeo hosting content for you to use on your own platform.

#### 2. Fair Use Experiments

Upload **at least 2 pieces of content** that test different aspects of fair use. Each piece should represent a different point on the spectrum of transformativeness. Suggested experiments:

**Raw copyrighted clip**: Upload a short segment (5-10 seconds) of copyrighted content with no modification. Then try a longer clip (30+ seconds). Compare results.

For each upload, document:

- Screenshot of successful upload
  ![Diagram](images&content/First%20Clip.png)
- Time until detection (immediate, hours, days, never detected)  
  never detected
- Screenshot of any warnings, flags, copyright claims, or takedown notices  
  nothing happened
- Final outcome (content stays up, gets muted, blocked in certain regions, completely removed, monetization disabled, etc.)  
  content stays up
- Any options presented to you (dispute, acknowledge, trim audio, etc.)  
  no options

Second clip for this experiment (longer clip)

- Screenshot of successful upload
  ![Diagram](images&content/Second%20Clip.png)
- Time until detection (immediate, hours, days, never detected)  
  never detected
- Screenshot of any warnings, flags, copyright claims, or takedown notices  
  nothing happened
- Final outcome (content stays up, gets muted, blocked in certain regions, completely removed, monetization disabled, etc.)  
  content stays up
- Any options presented to you (dispute, acknowledge, trim audio, etc.)  
  no options

**Remix or mashup**: Combine multiple sources or transform content in a creative way.

For each upload, document:

- Screenshot of successful upload
  ![Diagram](images&content/Mashup%20Clip.png)
- Time until detection (immediate, hours, days, never detected)  
  never detected
- Screenshot of any warnings, flags, copyright claims, or takedown notices  
  nothing happened
- Final outcome (content stays up, gets muted, blocked in certain regions, completely removed, monetization disabled, etc.)  
  content stays up
- Any options presented to you (dispute, acknowledge, trim audio, etc.)  
  no options

#### 3. AI-Generated Content Investigation

- Research findings:

  - What does the AI tool's terms of service say about copyright?  
    I used hailuo ai to generate my videos and they say that all user generated content is owned by the user but they can also use and distribute all user generated content as much as they want for free. The user is also liable for any third party complaint about user generated content and hailuo ai revokes any responsibility since they are not the owner. They are basically saying they want the user to be responsible for everything but they can also use any user generated content however they want. So you don't actually own any user generated content but are liable for any damages it may cause. (I'm not even sure if these are legal copyright terms of service)
  - Who owns the copyright to AI-generated content? (you, the AI company, the creators of training data, public domain/no one?)  
    according to the terms of service, I do, but practically the AI company also owns it. It's weird because there is also a clause about being able to file a complaint to the company if any generated content violates your copyright.
  - What is your platform's stated policy on AI-generated content?  
    Vimeo explicitly states that they require you to disclose when realistic videos are created using generative AI or altered using AI. That's basically it. So my content that I uploaded should be fine since it's definitely not realistic.

Create **at least 2 pieces of content** using AI tools (e.g., DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, Suno, etc.) with varying degrees of similarity to copyrighted works:

**Style mimicry**: Prompt that asks for content "in the style of" a specific artist, franchise, or creator (e.g., "in the style of Studio Ghibli" or "in the style of Taylor Swift")

Upload each piece to your chosen platform and document:

- What was the AI prompt?
  cartoon mouse dancing in disney style

- Screenshot of AI-generated output
  ![Diagram](images&content/Third%20Clip.png)
- Platform response (flagged, removed, allowed, etc.)
  allowed

**Original creation**: Use AI to generate completely original content as a control/baseline

Upload each piece to your chosen platform and document:

- What was the AI prompt?
  cartoon mouse dancing
- Screenshot of AI-generated output
  ![Diagram](images&content/Fourth%20Clip.png)
- Platform response (flagged, removed, allowed, etc.)
  allowed

#### 4. Legal Analysis

Apply what you've learned about copyright law to your experiments:

- **Fair Use Four Factors**: For each of your fair use experiments (Task 2), analyze how it performs under the four fair use factors:

  1. Purpose and character of the use (transformative? commercial?)
  2. Nature of the copyrighted work (creative vs. factual?)
  3. Amount and substantiality used
  4. Effect on the market for the original

For clips 1 and 2, i'm literally just showing the first bit of shawn mendes - stitches music video, this is definitely NOT fairuse and violates all 4 pillars. That being said, since no one uses vimeo to browse for content like they do youtube, the copyright holder probably doesn't care. I think the Mashup Clip where I create a list of best music videos can be considered transformative since it's giving new information. The original work is creative but I play a short clip of it to illustrate my opinion. I also don't use a substantial amount and the effect on the market for the original is non existant. That all being said, I know that music agency are very keen on doing DMCA take downs if they can gain money from it even if the video is transformative.
For the AI clips, it's theoritically transformative but I believe we need a new rule for AI in general since the video generated is from stolen art work that do have a copyright. A clear example is when I try to generate a generic cartoon mouse dancing, the data used to train the ai obviously stole from ratatouille the pixar film. That's clear copyright infringement, it's just that only really powerful companies can force these AI companies to comply. For example, you can't make chatGPT generate a video or image of mickey mouse now and that's because Disney is very powerful. However, if you are a small creator or artist, you are getting stolen from and there's literally nothing you can do about it.

- **Gap Analysis**: Discuss any gaps you observed (if any) between:

  - Legal theory (what copyright law says)
  - Platform policy (what the platform claims to do)
  - Actual enforcement (what actually happened)

  For Vimeo, even though my shawn mendes clips should've been flagged and privated, they are still up so Vimeo's auto detection can't be that good. I don't think they have an incentive to make it better either since they don't run ads, no one is going to pressure them to take copyrighted content off of their platform. That being said, I've only waited 24 hours so maybe in the next couple of days the videos will get flagged.
